# San-Francisco-GIS
A python program that uses the Geopy library's geocode function to find the latitude and longitude of various supermarkets in the San Francisco area, using only their address (ie: Address, City, State and Country)
It then creates a web map with Folium, marking the exact locations of these supermarkets on the map

NB: Should the program TIMEOUT upon running, please run the program again.
